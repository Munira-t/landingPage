# Landing Page Project

In this project, I used JavaScript ES6 to manipulate the DOM such as building a navigation bar dynamically and click and scroll events, add and remove elements and classes.

# table of contents 
all javaScript code is written in app.js some modifications were made in index.html such as adding sections and linking js src. also in styles.css add some class and modifying media queries.

# Feauters
- Bulid navigation bar dynamically as an unordered list.
- If the user scroll through the page it's shows which section is being viewed.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section.
